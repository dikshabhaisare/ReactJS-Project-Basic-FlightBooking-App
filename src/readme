🏗️ Part 1: Search Screen
🔹 Features

Dropdown: To City

Date pickers: Departure & Return

Button: Search Flights

🔹 Example API for Cities

Use this mock API (Beeceptor / Mocki):

URL:

https://mocki.io/v1/7d0e1b0e-0cf4-4bcd-93b8-99a2e2f84c7f


Sample Response:

{
  "cities": [
    {"city": "Delhi", "code": "DEL"},
    {"city": "Mumbai", "code": "BOM"},
    {"city": "Bangalore", "code": "BLR"},
    {"city": "Chennai", "code": "MAA"},
    {"city": "Kolkata", "code": "CCU"}
  ]
}


Populate both dropdowns with these cities.

🧭 Part 2: Results Screen
🔹 On “Search Flights” click:

Navigate to /results and show flight cards.

🔹 Example Flight Results API

URL:

https://mocki.io/v1/7159a9a1-fd3a-4721-9b1f-c30dfaf46d61

}

🎚️ Part 3: Filter Section (Good to Have)

Stops (Non-stop / 1-stop)

Price range (slider or min–max input)

📱 Part 4: Responsive Design

Use Tailwind’s grid and flex utilities

Breakpoints: sm, md, lg for mobile/tablet/desktop

Make cards wrap neatly

🧭 Navigation Flow

Select from/to cities + dates → click Search

/results → ResultsPage

Fetch flight results and display cards

Optional filters

Use localStorage to store last search
